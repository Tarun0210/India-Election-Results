SQL Queries for India General Election Results 2024
Project Description
This project analyzes the 2024 India General Election Results using SQL queries. It includes data extraction, transformation, and aggregation tasks to generate meaningful insights about the election outcomes, such as total seats won by political alliances, state-wise results, and voter behavior. The queries demonstrate advanced SQL techniques like joins, window functions, and Common Table Expressions (CTEs).

Features
Total Seat Calculations:
Total seats available across India.
State-wise seat availability.
Alliance Results:
Total seats won by NDA, I.N.D.I.A, and OTHER alliances.
Party-level breakdown of seats won within alliances.

Top Performers:
Candidates with the highest votes across constituencies.
Custom Queries:
Add new fields for party alliances and update results accordingly.
Technologies Used
Database: Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)
Language: SQL
Techniques:
Joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN)
